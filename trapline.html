This table gives some summary information for each trap within the trapping project.<br> You can use the search box below each column header to filter on a specific item (e.g.&nbsp;a specific trap line, trap, date or last species caught).<br> There is also a generic search box which will search any column.<br> <br> Clicking on any of the column headers will allow you to sort. Keep clicking to toggle between ascending or descending.<br> If you want to sort by more than one column, hold the shift button down when clicking any subsequent columns.<br> Keep holding the shift button down if you want to reverse the sort order.<br> <br> Examples on how you might use this table include;<br>
<ul type="dot">
<li>
Search for your trap line
</li>
<li>
Sort by last species caught (or use the search filter again) to find which traps catch the most or least of any species
</li>
<li>
Sort by last catch date to see which traps have caught recently and what species that was
</li>
<li>
Sort by days since last catch to see which traps haven’t had a recent catch
</li>
</ul>
<p><br> You can expand the number of rows with the ‘Show’ drop down selection at the bottom of the table.<br></p>
