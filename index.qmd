  The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kaitakeconservation/" target="_blank">Kaitake Ranges Conservation Trust</a> is a community volunteer group that help manage and run the stoat and ferret trapping network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitake_Range" target="_blank">Kaitake Ranges</a>, which are the northern most part of Te Papakura o Taranaki/Egmont National Park. This network is used to protect the native species, including relocated/released kiwi that are now successfully breeding. If you'd like to see some of the critters and plants that are found in the Kaitake Ranges you can look through observations people have recorded on <a href="https://inaturalist.nz/observations?lat=-39.16001050286571&lng=173.96740434027322&radius=3.4229983790009344" target="_blank">inaturalist</a>.

  This website is used to surface the catch data that we record in a way to make it easily accessible and useful to our members. New data is loaded every day; the last refresh was: <b>`{r} print(strftime(readRDS('date_refreshed.rds'), "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M"))`</b>.
  
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
```

<p>
  The site is made up of these sections:
  <ul type = "dot">
  <li><a href="catchsummary.html">Catch Summary</a>: An overall summary of catches over time</li>
  <li><a href="trapsummary.html">Trap Summary</a>: An interactive table for interrogating the status of traps and how well each trap is doing</li>
  <li><a href="traplinestatus.html">Trap Line Status</a>: An interactive table showing servicing history by trap line and highlighing whether lines are overdue for checks</li>
  </ul>
