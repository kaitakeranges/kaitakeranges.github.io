Examples on how you might use this table include;\n\n\nSearch for your trap line\n\n\nSort by last species caught (or use the search filter again) to find which traps catch the most or least of any species\n\n\nSort by last catch date to see which traps have caught recently and what species that was\n\n\nSort by days since last catch to see which traps haven’t had a recent catch\n\n\n You can expand the number of rows with the ‘Show’ drop down selection at the bottom of the table."
