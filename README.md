# Kaitake Ranges Conservation Trust

The plan for this repository is to host a website that surfaces trap.nz data related to the trapping done in the Kaitake Ranges. 
The goal is to help with things like knowing which trap lines haven't been completed recently or pulling recent catch data. This is very much a work in progress.
